                <h2>About Cats</h2>
                <p>Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that are often kept as pets. They are known for their agility, playful behavior, and ability to hunt vermin. Cats have been associated with humans for thousands of years and are one of the most popular pets worldwide.
                    Luckily, they are available for adoption in many animal shelters and rescue organizations. Adopting a cat not only provides a loving home for the animal but also helps reduce the number of homeless pets.
                    Each cat has its own unique personality and characteristics, making them fascinating companions. Whether you prefer a playful kitten or a calm adult cat, there is a feline friend out there for everyone.
